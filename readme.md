My personal dotfiles. Feel free to take a look (copy at your own risk).

I manage those with [chezmoi](https://github.com/twpayne/chezmoi).

The templates require a config file in `$HOME/.config/chezmoi/chezmoi.toml`
```toml
[data]
full_name = "<full name>"
email     = "<email address>"
pubkey    = "<SSH public key>"
```

Other setup steps can be found [here](setup.md).
